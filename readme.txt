# Modern Weather Dashboard: The Ultimate Weather Experience

A feature-rich weather application crafted with HTML, CSS, and advanced JavaScript concepts. This intuitive dashboard provides real-time weather data through API integration while showcasing best practices in front-end development.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Weather Information**: Accurate forecasts powered by a robust weather API
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: Customize your viewing experience based on preference
- **Favorites System**: Save locations for quick access to weather updates
- **Recent Searches History**: Easily track and revisit previously searched locations

## Technical Implementation
- **Pure Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, demonstrating core JS proficiency
- **Object-Oriented Architecture**: Modular code with dedicated classes for Weather API handling, Favorites management, and Recent Searches functionality
- **Local Storage Integration**: Persistent data storage for user preferences and history
- **Advanced DOM Manipulation**: Dynamic content rendering and event management
- **API Integration**: Efficient handling of external data with fetch API and error handling

## Development Journey
Completed as a 3-day intensive project, showcasing planning, implementation, and debugging skills:
1. Research and wireframing
2. Core functionality implementation and styling
3. Integration, testing, and optimization

// NOTE: This API key is deliberately deactivated and only shown for demonstration purposes.
// In a real application, API keys should be stored in environment variables.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a fully-functional, user-centric web application while implementing modern JavaScript practices and problem-solving through debugging challenges.
